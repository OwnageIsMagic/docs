If you receive an error message similar to **Unable to locate package {dotnet-package}** or **Some packages could not be installed**, run the following commands.

There are two placeholders in the following set of commands.

- `{dotnet-package}`\
This represents the .NET package you're installing, such as `aspnetcore-runtime-8.0`. This is used in the following `sudo apt-get install` command.

First, try purging the package list:

```bash
sudo dpkg --purge packages-microsoft-prod && sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
sudo apt-get update
```

Then, try to install .NET again. If that doesn't work, you can run a manual install with the following commands:

```bash
# Define the OS version, name, and codename
source /etc/os-release

# Download the Microsoft keys
sudo apt-get install -y gpg wget
wget https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc
cat microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor -o microsoft.asc.gpg
sudo mv microsoft.asc.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/

# Add the Microsoft repository to the system's sources list
wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/$ID/$VERSION_ID/prod.list
sudo mv prod.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/microsoft-prod.list

# Set ownership
sudo chown root:root /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.asc.gpg
sudo chown root:root /etc/apt/sources.list.d/microsoft-prod.list

# Update packages and install .NET
sudo apt-get update && \
  sudo apt-get install -y {dotnet-package}
```
